cookiecutters
=============

Some personal cookiecutter_ templates that I use. Feel free to browse, but do
not expect a lot of polish.

.. _cookiecutter: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

As I am currently unhappy with cookiecutter, the ``templates`` folders contains
a few experimental examples for `tpl
<https://github.com/mbr/binbin/tree/master/bin/tpl>`_.
